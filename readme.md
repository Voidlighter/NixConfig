Made not just to be simple, but to be as straightforward and understandable
as possible, not just to me, but also to a new Nix user.

I don't want fancy functions anymore. I already tried that. Now I want something
so readable that anyone can troubleshoot it. Because it is nice for others
to be able to easily help.

I still would like to avoid repeating code as much as possible, but that is
a lower priority than readability and practicality. "I could write a whole
function so that I say this once instead of twice, but... when I write it
twice, I can still understand what it does."

That's what I'm trying to do here. ✨*understand*✨
